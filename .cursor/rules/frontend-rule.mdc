### Rules for Frontend

- You must pay attention to visual clarity and contrast. Do not place white text on a white background.
- You must ensure the UX is pleasant. Boxes should grow to fit their contents, etc. 
- When asking the user for sensitive information - you must use password style text-entry boxes in the UI.
- You should use Next.js as it works best with Vercel. 
- This frontend will ultimately be deployed on Vercel, but it should be possible to test locally. 
- Always provide users with a way to run the created UI once you have created it.

### Theme & Vibe Preferences

- Visual style: calm, minimal, outdoors / hiking inspired.
- Primary accent color: magenta (#E20074).
- Secondary accent color: forest green (#2E7D32).
- Background: very light gray (#F7F7F9).
- Cards and content areas: white with soft shadow.
- Layout should feel breathable with generous spacing.
- UI should be simple: text input, send button, and response area.
- Copy tone: friendly, supportive, and encouraging.
